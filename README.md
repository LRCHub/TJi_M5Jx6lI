[00:26.46] It is cheesed with power
[00:29.77] And the morality of which it goes mad
[00:34.40] A lot of people became dogs
[00:37.88] Having tied to the chain
[00:40.04] Your happy there?
[00:48.54] 
[00:50.51] I want to be enjoying the life
[00:53.97] Though it will knock against a high-
[00:58.26] Wall hereafter I'm already dead
[01:02.03] However I was saved with the rock
[01:18.53] 
[01:06.31] I swore I at that time
[01:10.36] I will walk life that shines highest
[01:14.42] There is no fear, it gets it over though there
[01:20.37] Is a painful day too
[01:22.22] Now let's go, the wing expands and goes
[01:26.06] To look for freedom and the glory
[01:30.39] The world that extends to the place waits
[01:35.99] Surely for you
[01:42.99] 
[01:38.28] 踊らないか?
[01:40.10] Real Cinderella
[01:42.33] 傷だらけのガラスのマーチンで
[01:49.33] 
[01:46.11] Hey God, are you ready?
[01:48.31] Hey God, are you ready?
[01:50.28] Hey God, are you ready?
[01:52.00] 聞かせてよ bodies
[01:54.06] Hey God, are you ready?
[01:55.95] Hey God, are you ready?
[01:57.56] Hey God, are you ready?
[01:59.75] 絶頂を教えてやるよ tonight
[02:08.25] 
[02:38.09] I swore I at that time
[02:42.12] I will walk life that shines highest
[02:46.13] There is no fear, it gets it over though there
[02:51.34] Is a painful day too
[02:54.09] Now let's go, the wing expands and goes
[02:58.23] To look for freedom and the glory
[03:01.80] The world that extends to the place waits
[03:07.62] Surely for you
[03:14.62] 
[03:09.53] 踊らないか？
[03:11.78] Real Cinderella
[03:13.58] 傷だらけのガラスのマーチンで
[03:20.58] 
[03:17.65] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:19.60] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:21.83] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:23.68] 歪みを上げて
[03:25.86] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:27.75] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:29.93] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:31.55] 響かせてくれ tonight
[03:34.25] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:35.50] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:37.76] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:39.48] どうにでもしてくれ
[03:41.71] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:43.89] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:45.65] Hey God, are you ready?
[03:57.15] 
[03:48.22] 狂い出した夜に
[03:49.84] Do luck よりも甘い
[03:51.72] Fuck'n roll ぶち込んでくれ
